## \ud83d\udccc Overview
This project implements a **Neural Network (MLP)** to detect faults in **VLSI circuits** using binary test patterns. The system:
- **Trains a classifier model** to detect faults.
- **Tests new input patterns** and saves predictions.
- **Automatically logs test results and model evaluations.**

## \ud83d\udd39 1. Install Dependencies
To install the required Python libraries, run:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow
```

## \ud83d\udd39 2. Train the Model
To train the neural network model, run:
```bash
python scripts/train_model.py
```
\u2705 This will create and save `classifier.h5` inside `models/`.
\u2705 An **evaluation report** (`evaluation_report.txt`) will be saved in `results/`, logging model accuracy.

## \ud83d\udd39 3. Test the Model on New Data
To test the trained model on new input patterns, run:
```bash
python scripts/test_model.py
```
\u2705 This will append predictions to `results/test_results.csv` with timestamps.

## \ud83d\udd39 4. Test Results Storage
- All test results are stored in `results/test_results.csv`.
- Each test run appends new predictions to this file.
- Results include a timestamp to track when predictions were made.

## \ud83d\udd39 5. Model Evaluation Report
Each time the model is trained, an **evaluation report** is generated in `results/evaluation_report.txt`, containing:
- Training accuracy
- Timestamp of training completion


## \ud83d\ude80 Future Improvements
- Enhance model accuracy with additional hidden layers.
- Use real-world VLSI test pattern datasets.
- Implement visualization tools for better analysis.
- Deploy the model as a web-based or API service.
